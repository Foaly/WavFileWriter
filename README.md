WavFileWriter
=============

This is an easy to use class that enables your Teensy Audio Board to write WAV files directly to the SD card.
It nicely abstracts all the details away and offers a clean interface.

The code is inspired by the Recorder example of Paul Stoffregens Audio library and the SFML SoundFileWriterWav class.
Hence it is also licensed under the zlib license (see LICENSE.md).
